# Hi, 👋

I’m a cybersecurity enthoushiast. 
I spend a lot of time learning new techniques, experimenting with tools, and improving my problem-solving skills through CTFs (Capture The Flag).

This GitHub is where I share some of my projects and what I learn along the way.
But I'm still a beginner in the world of cybersecurity.

- 🔐 Interests: CTFs, pentesting, web exploitation
- 🧪 Currently exploring: New security tools and methodologies
- 📂 Learning plateformes: PicoCtf, Tryhackme, HackTheBox
