# Hi there 👋

I’m a junior cybersecurity analyst with a strong interest in IT security.  
I spend a lot of time learning new techniques, experimenting with tools, and improving my problem-solving skills through CTFs (Capture The Flag).

This GitHub is where I share some of my projects and what I learn along the way.
But I'm still a beginner in the world of cybersecurity 😄

- 🔐 Interests: CTFs, pentesting basics, web exploitation
- 🧪 Currently exploring: new security tools and methodologies
- 📂 Repositories: small projects, notes, and experiments
